# Ansible Dev Setup - Kubuntu üêß

This repository contains Ansible playbooks to install the necessary tools I find useful for
working as a Software Engineer on my Linux machine.

This has been designed for Kubuntu distro (22.10+) üñ≥

| Distro  | Version(s) | CPU            | SKU                                        |
|---------|------------|----------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Kubuntu | 22.10      | Intel (64-bit) | [Desktop](https://kubuntu.org/getkubuntu/) |

The structore of the files are like so:

  - main.yml
    - core.yml
    - tool a.yml, b.yml, c.yml etc.
    - final tasks : kde.yml, java.yml etc.

Tools I mainly use are:

- Java and Maven (provisioned with SDKman) ‚ô®Ô∏è
- Docker
- Node
- SDKMan
- LinuxBrew
- Bash

**Note** some programs are installed using snap.


Text shell customization assumes you're using bash.

GUI shell customization assumes you're using KDE on desktop Linux.
